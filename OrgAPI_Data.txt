The acronym \"ACF\" explains it very well, though it may seem hard to understand at first:</p>\r\n<p>A - Adventist. Adventists emphasize that the imminent second coming (\"advent\") of Jesus gives hope to each one of us because this will be the day when our whole life, regardless of how it was, can be made perfect, and we can become <strong>fully happy</strong>, just as God planned it to be.</p>\r\n<p>C - Christian. Christians know that Jesus <strong>loved</strong> each person, each identity, and each individual so much, that He decided to give up everything (including His life) so that we may be restored, and our lives - <strong>fulfilled</strong>. This focus on His amazing love is something that can truly change your life and ours.</p>\r\n<p>F - Fellowship. We all have a deep longing for a <strong>community and fellowship</strong>, and no one likes to feel alone or excluded, though this often happens on such a big campus as ours. But when we get to know God's love, we are so filled with it that we naturally tend (and are able) to share this gift with our community, while being focused on Jesus. No community becomes more <strong>united</strong> than the one where God is at the center.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Still wondering what all these words like \"God's love\", \"fulfillment\", \"<strong>true community</strong>\" or \"<strong>belonging</strong>\" mean?</p>\r\n<p>Come and join our <a title=\"Events at ACF-M\" href=\"https://win.wisc.edu/organization/acfm/events\"> next event</a>, and you'll figure it out!</p>\r\n<p>If you have any questions about our organization, please email Slava C.

      "Description": "<p>Alpha Epsilon Phi is a national sorority, founded October 24, 1909, by seven women, dedicated to helping women become the best they can be. These seven women were searching for a group of young women that would contribute to the growth of its members emotionally, intellectually and socially. We are a sorority that strives to inspire and support exemplary women dedicated to friendship and a lifelong commitment to sisterhood, while building on the vision of our founders. We prize individuality, encouraging each member to discover and develop the talents and abilities that make her unique. But just as we value individuality, we also prize togetherness, fostering friendships and a sense of belonging. When becoming a part of AEPhi, you are not just becoming a member of a sorority; you are becoming a sister in a family, full of love, trust and understanding that lasts a lifetime.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Epsilon Phi has two national philanthropies. Sharsheret is a national nonprofit organization of cancer survivors dedicated to addressing the unique challenges young women living with breast cancer deal with on a day to day basis. Elizabeth Glazer Pediatrics AIDS Foundation, our second national philanthropy, is one of the leading pediatric AIDS organizations. Elizabeth was a member of AEPhi Sigma Chapter, and while giving birth to her first child, she was transfused with blood that was infected with the AIDS virus, which she unknowingly passed along to her two children. The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing pediatric HIV infection and eliminating pediatric AIDS through research, advocacy, and prevention, care, and treatment programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Multa Corda Una Causa, Many hearts One purpose.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Furthermore, our annual suicide prevention walk, Out of the Darkness Madison Campus Walk, sponsored by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, provides hundreds of people from all over to join for a day of performances, stories, communal interaction, and a way to promote the suicide prevention movement.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, AFSP-UW is here to make sure no one ever feels alone or ashamed because of their mental state. We hope that by educating our student body about suicide and mental illness, we can create a safe, welcoming, mentally friendly campus that supports and helps those in need. We are here to ASK if others are okay, LISTEN to what they have to say, and guide them to the appropriate professional resources to, hopefully SAVE a life.</p>",

While working with these sites, we realized the opportunity gap that these artisans face. They are creating upscale, beautiful products that there is no demand for in their communities. Through realizing this, we wanted to create avenues to sell their products in the United States, allowing these artisans the opportunity to generate more income than they would be able to through selling solely at their local markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />We collaborate with artisans from 3 global communities: La Calera, Ecuador, Jalisco, Mexico, and Katmandu, Nepal. These artisans have few opportunities to participate in revenue generating activities. While they have the resources and skills to create beautiful and indigenous designs, the artisans are not aware of the current demands and trends in the United State's fashion market.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_paragraph\"><span style=\"color: #484848; font-size: x-large;\">Students and Educators&nbsp;</span><br /><br />This is where the students and staff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come in. The School of Human Ecology (SoHE) is proud to offer a class titled, \"Global Artisans: Design and Sustainability,\" where students collaborate online with our international partners to design new, higher end products that will generate increased sales and income for these artisans. There is also a &ldquo;Consumer Strategy &amp; Evaluation&rdquo; course, which works with the Wisconsin Union to decide how to best promote and sell the products at the Robin&rsquo;s Nest Cafe, which is located in SoHE.&nbsp;<br /><br />The operations, marketing, finances, and sales of the products are organized by the student organization, The Artisan Collective. The student leadership of this group focuses on developing business plans for sustainable models to expand product sales opportunities from local art fairs to wholesale opportunities. Our inventory is purchased directly from the artisans, allowing them to generate much needed income for education, health care, and food. All revenue generated in Madison will be used to operate the project, develop new products, and expand to new sites.</div>",

There is a lack of understanding of what science policy is and how it affects both public policy and scientific research. In order to fulfill our goal of educating students about science policy, we will have public seminars where invited speakers will present on various aspects of science policy. In addition, we wish to keep our student members updated on current science policy issues by holding meetings where we informally discuss these issues in a journal club setting. Being in the capital provides us with an amazing opportunity to work with senators and law makers. We hope to organize a relationship with the capital that affords graduate students the opportunity to meet policy makers and understand how policies involving science are managed and implemented from the policy makers&rsquo; perspective.</p>\r\n<p>In order to increase the awareness of science policy as a career, several seminars with invited and local speakers will be organized during the year. Through these seminars the graduate student community will be exposed to different careers and jobs in different sectors: government, private and non-profit. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Science policy issues affect scientists and the general public alike. For this reason, we believe that it is important for the public to understand the value of research and science. &nbsp;To address this goal, we will reach out to the community and educate them on currently relevant science topics. &nbsp;Through activities geared toward the non-scientific community, both in the local neighborhoods and on the University campus, we hope to demonstrate why the research done by graduate students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is important to the community at large. These activities will provide our members with experience communicating science topics to a general audience. &nbsp;Non-technical communication is a skill that is indispensable for scientists, especially those interested in science policy, where scientists frequently interact with a variety of non-scientific audiences.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Once students have made their challahs and desserts, we will bake their creations, and students can choose to stay and eat their baked goods fresh out of the oven, take them home, or pick them up the following day. We also can provide students with baking kits so that they can braid and bake challahs in their own kitchens. Some weeks will have themes or activities associated with them, such as embroidering challah covers, painting pumpkins, knitting, and other activities.</p>\r\n<p>Holding these weekly baking meetings gives individuals the opportunity to disconnect from all the deadlines and obligations of a college student&rsquo;s life and destress while focusing on baking with friends for one hour of the week, regardless of their religious identity or background. In addition to serving as a time for mental wellness, Challahbration serves as a social event, where students can easily meet members of the Jewish community or any members of the Madison community who share a love for challah baking. Baking challah weekly creates a community around Jewish values and provides the opportunity for students to preserve traditions from their childhood with the observance of Shabbat. In light of the Jewish value of Tzedakah, our weekly challah bakes are a source of food security for attendees. Furthermore, after students and Shabbat dinner have been provided for, any remaining challah will be donated to food banks in the area.</p>",

One of the longest continuously active fraternities on campus, the Lodge has become a staple of the University and the city of Madison since its founding in 1878. Generations of men look back at their experiences at 150 Iota Ct. as some of the most memorable times in their lives. We at the Lodge continually strive for development and enrichment in our active membership even today, instilling the feelings and traditions of previous members in our current active body.</p>\r\n<p>Activity outside of the Lodge is strongly encouraged, and many members are involved on the UW campus and in the local community. Members serve on the IFC Executive boards, serve on student government, participate in pre-professional and academic societies, and participate in club athletics. Many events within the Lodge, prepared and developed by the brotherhood, help to break up the daily grind of academic life. These events include intramural sports teams as well as socials with sororities, all helping to instill valuable personal and life-long skills for our members. Moreover, the Lodge is a force in philanthropic work in the Madison community, from our volunteer efforts at Gio's Garden to the Iota Open golf outing, which has raised thousands of dollars for local charities. Additionally, the Lodge has been very successful in Humorology, having won raising the highest total of funds twice in recent years.</p>\r\n<p>Known as &lsquo;Alphas&rsquo; of Chi Psi, Alpha Iota has long list of distinguished alumni including the great American historian Stephen E. Ambrose, renowned Milwaukee architect Andrew C. Eschweiler, former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, the Pabst family from Pabst Brewing Co., and Daily Show producer Ben Karlin. Today, members come from across the country and world finding fraternity life at the Lodge one of the best parts of their college experience.</p>\r\n<p>In many ways, the fraternity experience has drifted astray from its founding principles: bettering men and assisting them in the development of their intellectual, moral and social life. These values are what The Lodge is built upon, where we stress the importance of academic excellence, community service, and social tact. We are continually building a better experience for men who seek more out of their University years than the average undergraduate, and we&rsquo;re searching for a select group of excellent young gentlemen to contribute to that experience.</p>",
      "Summary": "The Lodge has become a staple of the University and the city of Madison since its founding in 1878. As a fraternity, we uphold our founding principles of bettering men and assisting them in the development of their intellectual, moral, and social life.",

From the first day it was founded, CSSA has aimed to build a prosperous community that will consist of not only Chinese students and scholars, but also those with other ethnic backgrounds who have an interest in Chinese tradition and culture.<br /><br />After years of endeavors by the&nbsp;founders and the successors, CSSA has become the leading group in promoting the&nbsp;Chinese culture and tradition. Take the gala of the Spring Festival as an example. This annual event, which is open to all UW-Madison students and faculty for&nbsp;free, consisting of various kinds of shows, such as traditional and modern dances, singing and talk show. It has been held successfully for more than 20 years at the Memorial Union of the UW-Madison. This event has become so popular that&nbsp;the Chinese students, scholars, and their families have long taken it for granted&nbsp;as an opportunity for union and feast. Nowadays, more and more U.S families enjoy this annual show; many of them even participate in the performances. Other traditional activities of CSSA include the celebration of <br />Mid-Autumn Festival (also known as the Moon Festival).<br /><br />There is no doubt that these activities have benefited the Chinese people by adding to their life excitement&nbsp;and communal feelings. By showcasing Chinese culture and tradition, they also, and maybe more importantly, benefited the Madison community as a whole. It should be specially noted, however, that we have not made these achievements all alone. Instead, we owe many thanks to several university administration offices, such as Associated Students of Madison, International Student and Scholar Services, and Registered Student Organization Office, and many other local organizations and individuals, such as Madison Chinese Language Society, to name a few.</p>",

Together, we find and share the most effective resources for learning, then share or talk about them. We also perform walkthroughs of interesting data technologies like web-scraping with Python or using a Twitter API to gain actionable data. Moving forward, we would like to better network students with faculty, companies, and each other on new ventures, from Kaggle competitions to semester-long research projects to internships and jobs (and free food).</p>",

      "Description": "<p>On the evening of November 5, 1834, 30 students met at Williams College to form the social fraternity of Williams College, today known as Delta Upsilon. Delta Upsilon is the only fraternity today that practices non-secrecy. Thus, anyone considering joining Delta Upsilon may attend our chapter meetings in order to get a feel for how things operate. Our chapter&nbsp;is founded on four basic principles; the development of character, the promotion of friendship, the diffusion of liberal culture, and the advancement of justice.</p>\r\n<p>The Madison chapter of Delta Upsilon is one of the strongest chapters in the country as well as a leader on this campus. Our chapter&nbsp;is situated on Lake Mendota complete with a large porch, patio and peer, all overlooking beautiful Lake Mendota.&nbsp;Our house currently&nbsp;has twenty two live-in members during the school year. Delta Upsilon is one of the only fraternities on campus to also have a full-time cook.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Delta Upsilon is more than just one big social club. Everyone in the chapter&nbsp;comes to have a good time, make life-long connections, and continue our traditions. Many members of Delta Upsilon have&nbsp;gone on to become leaders in school and in society. Alumni of our chapter include J.P. Morgridge (CEO Cisco Systems), Williams Davidson (Harley Davidson), William Kellett (CEO Kimberly Clark), and Brewster Shaw (Astronaut).</p>",

Now in its 21st year of operation, the once small student chapter has expanded to over&nbsp;200 active members and maintains a minimum five-year commitment to five communities, making ours the largest chapter of Engineers Without Borders in the United States. <br /><br />EWB strives to educate globally conscious and internationally responsible engineers and students. We embody the Wisconsin Idea by not only performing engineering and social services in the state of Wisconsin, but by providing engineering and social services to communities around the globe. <br /><br />Our chapter currently works in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Uganda, and Puerto Rico. Ours is a true partnership with our host communities, and community participation is crucial to the success of our projects. Communities play an active role in project selection and exhibit complete control over our projects. Community ownership during the design process is important, but community ownership post-implementation is necessary in order to maintain our projects and to ensure that our projects fulfill their intended purpose.</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_im\">Please see our website at<a href=\"http://ewbuwmadison.weebly.com/\">http://ewbuwmadison.weebly.com/</a>&nbsp;for more information!</div>",

Our mission is to showcase the excellent research undertaken by undergraduates in the economics department and to convey economic literature to wider audiences. EQ Journal publishes articles on an annual basis in Spring. Each Equilibrium volume includes articles written and edited by undergraduates about analysis-based articles, research reviews, opinion pieces on trending topics in economics, and faculty interviews with department members. Copies of previous EQ editions can be found at the Undergraduate Economics Office (7238 Social Sciences), and digital issues are accessible for download on this website.</span></p>\r\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The journal writing process occurs primarily in the Fall semester. Contributing Writers select a topic of interest and follow an in-depth writing/editorial process to make their pieces the best they can be for Physical Journal publication. Contributing Writers are required to engage in rounds of peer review and faculty review to reflect, critique, and improve forthcoming pieces. For potential writers joining in the Spring semester, our Editorial Board encourages you to submit pieces for our EQ Online Journal. This online platform offers writers flexibility to write what they want and when they want to with simplified reviewing requirements. Also be on the lookout for the Econ Department&rsquo;s weekly email, as it will include information on upcoming EQ meetings. We hope to see your stellar work soon!</span></p>",

We are a voluntary non-profit organization registered with the student organization office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the span of eighteen years we have grown into an organization with over 1400 members. Our members belong to different backgrounds and age groups. Membership to our organization is open to all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Nature of Activities</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Music and dance concerts:</strong> We invite renowned artists and performers belonging to different schools and genre of Indian classical music and dance to perform at UW-Madison. Most of the artists we invite are recipients of several national and international awards. These artists could be instrumentalists or vocalists belonging to either of the two main schools of Indian music, Hindustani and carnatic. Through these high quality music and dance concerts, we hope to demonstrate the richness and diversity of Indian culture. Such experiences help enhance the cross-cultural diversity on campus. The concerts are held primarily in the premier auditoriums on campus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Outdoor trips:</strong> We organize a Fall Colors camping trip at the peak of the renowned fall color activity in the north woods of Wisconsin. The popularity of this event is shown by the rising numbers every year. This is a wonderful opportunity for students to be a part of a truly Wisconsin experience. We also organize ski trips to ski resorts close to Madison and white-water rafting trips to north Wisconsin. <br /><br /><strong>Social &amp; cultural events: </strong>We organize various events like table tennis tournaments, trivia quizzes and other literary events. We also organize cultural events which provide an opportunity for students to showcase their talents. Through these events we aim to present the rich Indian history and ethnic diversity. These events also provide an opportunity to the UW community to witness traditional costumes, and savor authentic Indian cuisine. <br /><br /><strong>Voluntary service to new students: </strong>We provide voluntary help to the Indian students new to the Madison campus, to settle down and get acclimatized to UW lifestyle. We help students with temporary accommodation, and conduct several orientation programs for their benefit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Instruction is given from the most basic level and increases in difficulty as the students learn the techniques required to control their body and mind. All three traditional components of karate training (kata, kihon, and kumite) are taught at the dojo. You do not need to have prior experience in martial arts - our instructors teach you everything starting from white belt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While the instruction centers on karate as a martial art, portions of the training involve self-defense applications and karate as a competitive sport. Our club regularly sends teams of men and women to regional and national collegiate competitions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Japanese Karate Club is affiliated nationally with the <a href=\"http://www.aakf.org/\"> American Amateur Karate Federation</a>, and internationally with the Japan Karate Association International and the <a href=\"http://www.wtkfkarate.org/\">World&nbsp;Traditional Karate Federation</a>. All ranking is done under their auspices. Club members regularly attend clinics at the main dojos of the Great Lakes and North Central Regions of the AAKF.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Participation is open to all students, faculty, and staff. Members are not required to come to all practices, however, average attendance of once or twice a week is usually necessary for consistent advancement in rank. Most members try to attend as frequently as their class schedule permits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fun fact!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our club has been a University of Wisconsin-Madison sports club since 1976 and the current head instructor is Vassil Peytchev, a Sandan (third degree black belt). Instruction is also performed by other regionally qualified first, second, and third degree black belt instructors.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>See you at practice!</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

From filling the seats at Madison&rsquo;s historic Orpheum Theatre and acclaimed Overture Centre to singing the National Anthem at a sold-out Brewers/Cubs rivalry at Miller Park, to traveling across the United States and Mexico, the MadHatters seem to have their world on a string and their opportunities endless.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br />The MadHatters have one live and six&nbsp;studio albums and are working on their seventh&nbsp;studio recording to be released later this year. Their first album released in 2002, State Street, had a track earn a spot on the 2002 Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) CD and is credited as the first a cappella album recorded in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Their second album, 2004&rsquo;s Friday After Class, exploded their fan base, becoming a &ldquo;best seller&rdquo; on a cappella website worldwide. Not For Credit, their third studio release was produced in 2007 and received two national recording awards, including another BOCA inclusion with &ldquo;I Believe (When I Fall in Love).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With their unmistakable attire in their Wisconsin red jackets, the MadHatters are a presence on the UW campus that brings everyone to clap their hands and stomp to the beat. Not only does the audience enjoy the show, but the MadHatters love performing it. Whether it be another sold-out show in Madison or singing at your grandma&rsquo;s 80th birthday party, the MadHatters bring the fun wherever they go.</p>\r\n<p>They&rsquo;ll dance, they&rsquo;ll shout (shout!) and they&rsquo;ll shake your bodies down to the ground. They are the MadHatters.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your interest in the group - we'd love to see you at a show sometime soon!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
      "Summary": "The MadHatters are an internationally touring men's a cappella group based out of Madison, WI. Singing the tunes both past and present, their 13 vocalists and vocal percussionist will make you dance in your seat and hit repeat over and over again.",

Students can use PLA sessions as part of their normal study routine.<br /><br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How do these sessions look?</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Sessions are composed of about 5-20 peers/students (subject to change according to student demands per semester) and 1-2 Facilitator(s). Facilitators facilitate discussion of the course material presented by the obtained weekly outlines in a form of questions and peers will have prepared for these sessions beforehand in order to carry out the discussion among one another. Peers will be teaching peers and facilitators are there as an extra resource if the group becomes stuck on a particular subject of their discussion.</p>\r\n<p>More information:&nbsp;<a id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_m_6324779691780019125LPlnk25452\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDQD8iAcBwY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr />v=ZDQD8iAcBwY</a></p>\r\n<p>See it from faculty's point of view:&nbsp;<a id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_m_6324779691780019125LPlnk518182\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVWGNK8fyBs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr />v=vVWGNK8fyBs</a><a id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_m_6324779691780019125LPlnk25452\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDQD8iAcBwY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Courses that utilize PLA:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Current Semester (Spring 25):</p>\r\n<p>Psychology 202, Psychology 454, Chemistry 103 &amp; 104, Organic Chemistry 343 &amp; 345, Physics 104, Introductory Biology 151 &amp; 152, Anatomy 335, &amp; Physiology 337</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>To become involved please contact PLA via email for fill out the sign-up form. </strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>You may participate as:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong>1) <strong>A Peer</strong><br />To become a peer of a study group you must be enrolled in the course for that study group.

      "Description": "<p>Alpha Theta is over 100 years old and one of the oldest Phi Kappa Sigma chapters. We regained our charter on April 19, 2008,&nbsp;and are beginning to record a new page in the history books of Phi Kappa Sigma at UW-Madison. We prefer to do things differently. For example, along with a typical chapter house, we have an 1800 sq. ft property called \"The Crypt\" on West Washington Avenue where we hold meetings, study, and hang out.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we focus on personal and professional development. Phi Kappa Sigma looks for those who are dedicated to improving themselves and the community through an enriching experience in academics, service, and leadership. These traits can all be seen in Phi Kappa Sigma&rsquo;s mission statement:&nbsp;&ldquo;We exist to integrate scholastic excellence; community enrichment; and principled, effective leadership among reputable men. Through both fellowship and fraternity, our members persistently endeavor towards their individual and collective aspirations. Ultimately, we recruit, develop and yield 'Men of Honor.'\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, our graduates have been very successful.&nbsp;Since re-chartering in 2008, our alumni went on to jobs/internships at Tesla, Apple Inc., The White House, Target Corporation, General Mills, SC Johnson, Caterpillar, MLB.com, Teach for America, EPIC Systems, Google LLC, and more! Recent graduates also attended the University of Michigan Medical School and UCLA Law School.</p>\r\n<p>Nationally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a democratic national structure where undergraduates vote on and make decisions on issues at our national convention every two years. Additionally, our fraternity was the first to adopt a non-discrimination clause, allowing men of any race, religion, and social class to join our organization. Brothers believed that brotherhood was more than skin deep.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, Phi Kappa Sigma is the only fraternity to have a college established in their name: Phi Kappa Sigma Male College, founded in 1859 in Monticello, Arkansas. Lastly, our national organization gives out over $60,000 in scholarships each year, more than any other fraternity.</p>",

It was co-founded by our chapter in 1915 with four basic goals:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">\r\n<li>To foster high ideals in the engineering profession</li>\r\n<li>To stimulate and support departmental activities</li>\r\n<li>To promote professional welfare</li>\r\n<li>To develop leadership and citizenship</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif;\"><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 14px;\">History:</span></span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">With the twentieth century came the realization that honor societies made a definite contribution to the department and that membership required active participation. Pi Tau Sigma came into being on March 16, 1915, at the University of Illinois. A similar organization embarked November 15, 1915, at Wisconsin and other local organizations (such as the Carzeuran of Purdue) were soon to become active.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The early leaders: Professors C.R. Richards, A.C. Willard, and O.A. Leutwiler of the University of Illinois; G.L. Larson of the University of Wisconsin; G.A. Young of Purdue University; and J.V. Martenis of the University of Minnesota, stand out for their early contributions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In ten years Pi Tau Sigma grew to six chapters in the middlewest (Illinois Alpha, Wisconsin Alpha, Purdue Beta, Minnesota Gamma, Illinois Delta, and Missouri Epsilon). In 1925 the expansion continued to the east with the Penn State Zeta Chapter being installed. Six years later the Texas Kappa Chapter, and the following year the Colorado Mu Chapter established chapters in the south and west. Also in 1932 the expansion continued southeast to Georgia Tech Nu Chapter. It was not until nine years later that the first chapter was installed on the Pacific coast (Oregon State Omega). In twenty-six years Pi Tau Sigma became truly a national mechanical engineering honor society with a total of twenty-five chapters. During the succeeding four years nine additional chapters were installed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">From 1947 to 1958 forty new chapters were installed. The Chapter-At-Large was established in 1954. The installations completed thus far bring the total established chapters to one hundred and fifty-seven.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">O.C.K. Hutchinson, University of Illinois, and J.B. Wilkinson, University of Wisconsin, met early in 1916 to arrange plans for making the organization national, under the name of Pi Tau Sigma. The coalition took place in Chicago, March 12, 1916, at which the matter if chapter designation was decided and the two chapters become Illinois Alpha and Wisconsin Alpha.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

These resources include mentoring, MCAT information and preparation, networking, social support, shadowing, volunteer opportunities, and professional development.

Professional development will consist of resume editing, communication improvement, emailing practices, and do&rsquo;s/dont&rsquo;s of networking. The latter half of each session will consist of a discussion of weekly market movements (Dow, S&amp;P, and commodities) and the drivers behind the movements. We will go through sell-side research reports and publish our own findings based on real-world data.</p>\r\n<p>Students will also take the free Bloomberg Market Concepts course in the library to enhance their understanding for the markets. As the semester progresses, we will be speaking with alumni in S&amp;T and Asset Management about their work/experiences, and get their perspectives on the markets to further enhance the education of our members.</p>\r\n<p>During winter break sophomores&nbsp; will travel to New York City and Chicago to meet with the sales and trading and asset management divisions across numerous banks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our core goal: to increase the presence of badgers in the financial services industry.</p>",

Come by any time, no experience is necessary!</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"font: normal normal normal 1.4em/normal georgia,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #7d2222;\">Who we are</h4>\r\n<p>Shorin-Ryu Karate is a club sport that has been teaching students martial arts skills since 1972. Currently we have several Senseis (teachers), many of whom are students and staff at the university. Students in this class come from all walks of life, sharing the common desire to study a martial art. The ultimate goals of this dojo are to teach personal self-protection skills, improve physical fitness, share the rich history of the Shorin-Ryu martial arts, and to create a learning environment for self-mastery.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"font: normal normal normal 1.4em/normal georgia,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #7d2222;\">A typical class...</h4>\r\n<p>During a typical class, students start with some warm-up drills and body-weight fitness exercises, then practice a wide variety of techniques through kata (drills) and bunkai (practical applications).We utilize individual drills, partner drills, and group drills.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, we engage in light to moderate contact and kobudo, or the ancient weapons of karate like bo, sai, nunchaku, tonfa etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"font: normal normal normal 1.4em/normal georgia,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #7d2222;\">Training Philosophy</h4>\r\n<p>The study of kata is central to the martial arts, and a fundamental part of our curriculum. Kata are the forms which illustrate how individual techniques are put together to defend ourselves if ever the need should arise. The kata, which may be interpreted as a sequence of simple offensive techniques (e.g. punching, grappling, throwing etc.), have more subtle interpretations. The Okinawan masters who studied this art developed pressure point and joint manipulations that allow a karateka to control a much larger opponent. Our dojo studies these techniques, and integrates them into an effective personal self-defense system.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p2\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;\">Typically, new students participate in learning pressure point methods and joint locks right away. Our first three kata are readily accessible to new students. Rank is not based strictly on how long a student has studied martial arts, but rather by ability to perform kata and explain bunkai (applications). On average, a new student can assimilate the entire introductory curriculum within one or two semesters. This represents proficiency at basic techniques and selected kata.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p3\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; text-align: justify;\">Advanced students may study the kobudo, or the ancient weapons as training devices, although emphasis is still placed on the effective use of empty hands (kara-te) to defend oneself. Additionally, advanced students earn teaching responsibilities. A student's training culminates in his or her black belt test, which represents proficiency in karate. Really, however, the black belt is only a beginning of another journey, into the great breadth and depth of the martial arts.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"font: normal normal normal 1.4em/normal georgia,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #7d2222;\">Summary</h4>\r\n<p>Teaching tangible self-defense skills in a friendly, collegiate atmosphere, Shorin-Ryu Karate Club draws on the strength of its members to enhance the martial arts experience. Although we pride ourselves on training in the traditional Okinawan skills, we also incorporate modern methods into our training to assure the best class content possible. We attend a few local tournaments, and individuals are encouraged to explore seminars that come to the Chicago area. Since we associate with a second Shorin-Ryu dojo (located at the YMCA), we enjoy a great sharing of knowledge, skill and camaraderie. We are always happy to welcome new members.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>",
      "Summary": "Shorin-Ryu Karate is a traditional Okinawan style of Karate. We focus on the study of kata (or forms) which combine striking, pressure point techniques and joint manipulations, all of which are useful in self-defense. We also study ancient weapons arts.",

Jordan, Daniel William Cooper, Franklin Howard Scobey and James Parks Caldwell, wanted something better in a fraternity during their collegiate experience, and from that recognition, a dream was born &mdash; the fraternity of Sigma Chi.</p>\r\n<p>In short, Sigma Chi began because good men chose to act.</p>\r\n<p>Our seven Founders recognized that a principle-driven lifestyle should be paramount in an individual&rsquo;s lifelong quest to achieve progressive development, and that the world in which they lived had a great need for ethical leaders whose core principles were based on the possession of remarkable character.</p>\r\n<p>Sigma Chi&rsquo;s story has been building on itself since 1855 and, indeed, the Fraternity has changed dramatically since that time. When those seven college students gathered together for the first time, there were no telephones, no automobiles, no planes, no Internet, not even electricity &mdash; essentially, their lives were devoid of any of the modern amenities we are used to. Yet, somehow, they prospered.</p>\r\n<p>Without iPhones, the Internet, rapid transit, or even the possibility of an immediate connection outside of the small town of Oxford, Ohio, and their roughly 300 fellow students, they somehow knew that they had planted the seed for something amazing to grow. Through it all, they found in themselves and each other an uncommon strength of character to pursue a dream and to pass that dream on to other young men who would carry it forward.</p>\r\n<p>Their dream was simple &mdash; to enhance the leadership abilities of men by refining their character through the framework of Friendship, Justice and Learning &mdash; our three guiding principles.</p>\r\n<p>Seven young men set the foundation for a lifelong course of development that has since provided more than 300,000 men with the structure to understand how to make a positive influence on the world.</p>\r\n<p>The ranks of Sigma Chis now include titans of industry, celebrities, political leaders, husbands, fathers, brothers and many more. Each member brings so many different characteristics to the world, yet we all bring the same endowment of character that our world today so badly needs.</p>\r\n<p>Principle-driven leaders are needed now more than ever before, and the fact that Sigma Chi makes a concerted effort to contribute to the development of such men is what makes the Fraternity so important today.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The sorority focuses on five principles - academics, community service, cultural awareness, social interaction, and morals and ethics - to unite their members as \"hermanes por vida\" (siblings for life). <br /><br />Since its beginnings, Sigma Lambda Gamma has implemented national programs to empower their members and women of the community, such as the Young Women&rsquo;s Leadership Program and Emotional Intelligence. They have also partnered up with other organizations to improve political, educational, and social conditions in the United States. A siblinghood of over 8,000 members, the sorority believes that Culture is Pride, Pride is Success and explores the richness in the traditions of Latina culture. This encompasses the cultural heritages of Native Americans (North, Central and South), Europeans, Africans, Asians and their multiple and interesting mixtures. They celebrate the diversity of the backgrounds of all the members of the sorority, representing over 110 nationalities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Today, Sigma Lambda Gamma is the largest, historically Latina-based multicultural national sorority, and one of the fastest growing fraternal organizations in chapters and alumnae associations throughout the United States, having expanded to more than 100 universities in less than 20 years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Membership in Sigma Lambda Gamma is open to any woman who meets the membership requirements.

      "Description": "<p>The National Student Steel Bridge Competition is an annual competition amongst approximately 200 schools across North America which challenges engineering students to design, fabricate, and build a 1:10 scale steel bridge that conforms to the specifications laid out in the competition rules. These rules change each year to keep the competition fresh and exciting. Bridges are scored at competitions based on Construction Economy and Structural Efficiency. The goal is to build a bridge that is strong, light, and easy to put together.</p>\r\n<p>The fall semester is spent designing the bridge using the popular structural analysis program SAP2000. Team members are taught the fundamentals of the program during meetings, and are encouraged to assist in the design of the bridge. We also utilize the TEAM Lab to fabricate our own member connections, and many team members complete the requirements for obtaining their&nbsp;\"Intro to Machining\" training, allowing them access to the shop.</p>\r\n<p>After the structural design is complete, the bridge is drawn in AutoCAD and a complete plan set is created. The plans are then brought to a local manufacturing company over winter break, who generously helps members fabricate the bridge for one week in January.</p>\r\n<p>Spring semester is spent modifying the bridge and practicing construction runs. One of the goals of the competition is to put the bridge, which is fabricated in pieces, together as fast as possible. We spend months practicing so that we are as fast as possible at competitions.</p>\r\n<p>The team competes in a regional competition, typically in early April, and hopefully a national competition in June. This year, our regional event will be in Chicago between UIC and IIT, and nationals are at Brigham Young University. The UW-Madison team has been very successful, competing in the national competition 20+ years in a row.</p>\r\n<p>This year we are looking for lots of new members to assist in the design, fabrication and construction our bridge. We have lofty goals set for this school year and we are going to need a lot of involvement to achieve them. If you are interested in joining, please contact us via e-mail at steelbridgeuw@gmail.com or attend one of our meetings. We hope to hear from you, and On Wisconsin!</p>",

Developed in Korea, and practiced&nbsp;by over 7 million people worldwide, it is also a highly competitive Olympic Sport.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We are the official Taekwondo Club of UW-Madison. As an official Sport Club, our competition team represents UW-Madison at various local and regional tournaments as well as the National Collegiate Taekwondo Championship. However, we do not require members to compete. Every year we have many students join who are simply looking to learn a fun new sport, make friends, and get in shape.</p>\r\n<p>We are affiliated with the&nbsp;<em>World Taekwondo Federation</em> (the&nbsp;Olympic) style Taekwondo. We are taught by very experienced instructors, drawn from University staff and the student body. All of our instructors are Kukkiwon certified black belts and most of them have cross trained in multiple martial arts. Our instructors work hard to balance a traditional approach to martial arts training and&nbsp;the dynamic, quick, and explosive kicking style of full-contact Olympic sparring. Beyond the striking elements of Taekwondo, our club also emphasizes throws, breakfalls, joint-locks, and other techniques necessary to a well rounded self defense and martial arts program.</p>\r\n<p>We also provide&nbsp;opportunities for students to get involved on campus and in the local community through fundraising for charities, volunteering at our self-defense seminars, and much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The mission of the Taekwondo Club of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is to instruct members in the techniques and tenets of Taekwondo; to provide opportunity for competitive members to represent the university at an elite level; and, to facilitate an environment where member growth positively impacts the team, the university, and the community.

As aficionados of theater, one of our primary goals is to bring written scripts to life so that we can experience both the practical elements and the academic elements of the theater. We hope to grow a community of spectators within our department and to foster collaboration among our colleagues. As members of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and the Interdisciplinary Theatre Program, we also aim to take Hispanic theater and the community that we have created outside the walls of the tenth floor of Van Hise Hall. D&eacute;cimo&nbsp;Piso was established in August 2012 by graduate students of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. We work collectively and equally as members of the group and choose leadership roles like director, assistant director, producer, etc. democratically. This creates a very communal and representative dynamic. The group welcomes students of all areas of study to participate. Currently, its members come from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and&nbsp;the Interdisciplinary Theatre Studies Program, and we welcome the entire undergraduate and graduate student body to participate. Advanced undergraduates, faculty members, or interested community members are also welcome to take part in the group.</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_column\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_column\">Though in prior years the group has mainly read and produced plays in Spanish, we are open to reading and producing works in Portuguese, Catalan, U.S. Latino, or other languages. We have produced works from Spanish and Latin American playwrights, and works ranging from the 17th to the 21st centuries. This breadth demonstrates our commitment to explore pieces from all geographical regions and time periods in Hispanic culture. In past years, the group has met to read out loud and discuss short works of theater in the Fall semester before choosing one or two to produce in the Spring semester. In the present, we will remain committed to our theatrical practice as we simultaneously engage with a research-oriented approach to what theatre and performance mean in the Hispanic and Luzo-Brazilian worlds through our first annual talk series.&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We want you to protect your IP while still being open to sharing ideas and collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>We have no set policy regarding non-disclosure agreements or keeping things secret. We want you to share your idea. If you&rsquo;re afraid of the idea getting taken, then you don&rsquo;t have to share your entire &lsquo;secret sauce&rsquo; recipe with everyone. In other words, Ford could have talked about his &lsquo;assembly line&rsquo; idea without getting into the details of creating one. To create conversation and brainstorming, you only need to describe at a very high-altitude view what you&rsquo;re doing, not the nitty gritty details. You can save your IP while being open about your ideas &ndash; it is possible. And in today&rsquo;s knowledge economy, the only way to collaborate is by sharing ideas.</p>\r\n<p>No idea can be 100% original and uninfluenced by prior ideas. If someone &lsquo;steals&rsquo; your idea, it probably means they are using parts of your idea, parts of prior ideas and parts of their own ideas to make something that is much different than your original intention. That&rsquo;s the spirit of creativity! Sharing ideas and sparking other product ideas.</p>\r\n<p>If you decide to work with other students, you control that relationship 100% and should talk about IP sharing and what you think is acceptable. At this point you should reach out to the UW Law &amp; Entrepreneurship clinic which gives free legal advice (and told us to tell you they want to hear your ideas!).</p>",

      "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wim Hof Club (Hoffers) is based on three core principles: breathing, cold therapy, and commitment to mastering the mind. Based on the &ldquo;Wim Hof Method,&rdquo; our mission is to make individuals happier, healthier, and stronger, reawakening our forgotten inner human power: to adapt to extreme temperatures and survive within our natural environment. We accomplish this through guided breathing and meditation sessions, followed by cold or heat exposure (e.g. cold showers, lake plunges, or saunas). The tangible long term benefits of these practices are profound: increased energy, reduced stress levels, reduced inflammation, better sleep, heightened focus, improved athletic performance/recovery, and most notably, immunity to sickness. Need validation? Wim Hof, the founder of the method, holds 20 Guinness World Records for withstanding extreme temperatures. He climbed Everest and Kilimanjaro in only shorts and shoes, stayed comfortable in ice baths for hours, and ran a full marathon in the Namib desert (50 degrees celsius, 122 Fahrenheit) with no water or food. Wim understands the human body&rsquo;s desire for nature, meditation, and discomfort, which explains his passion to veer a society away from an epidemic of depression and other mental illnesses. Phones and other technology lead to extreme comfort and luxury that our ancestors and evolution did not prepare us for. It is no surprise that rates of depression are skyrocketing as our society moves away from the way humans are supposed to live. We must reclaim our bodies, minds, and souls by striving for greater meaning in life rather than simply living a life of ease and, consequently, sadness. Come join us every week, rain, snow, or shine, at Memorial Union and seek discomfort with us!</span></p>",

      "Description": "<p>Wisconsin Equestrian is made up of a team of approximately 20 riders from all backgrounds and disciplines. Experience levels range from horse lovers who have never had the chance to take up riding to those who have been successful in the upper levels of equitation, hunters, and jumpers. Although the Wisconsin Equestrian Team rides and competes in hunt seat equitation, members of ALL disciplines are welcome and encouraged to tryout.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Each member gets an average of 1 hour of riding time per week, and extra lessons can be scheduled with the Hoofer Riding Club. Wisconsin Equestrian Team uses the horses and facility of Sugar Creek Stables, located in Brooklyn, WI. It is not necessary to have a car in order to join the team as carpools are organized for every event including lessons, practices, socials, and horse shows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The team provides a great social network as our season spans the entire school year, rather than just a semester. Wisconsin Equestrian also plans multiple social events throughout the year so everyone may get to know each other and create a bond of friendship and team competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Time Commitment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The time commitment for the Wisconsin Equestrian Team is a perfect balance between work and play, providing team members with several opportunities to ride while still maintaining plenty of time for their studies.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lessons</strong></p>\r\n<p>Team members are divided into lesson groups of maximum 4-5 people and take one-hour long lesson a week with a coach. If the coach must cancel a lesson due to an emergency or unsafe weather conditions, the lesson will be rescheduled for a later date in the semester. If a rider misses their lesson, they are responsible for making it up on their own. Lessons are held at Sugar Creek Stables.</p>\r\n<p>* For lessons, riders must commit additional time to groom and tack up horses before the scheduled riding time and untack and cool down horses after. This usually adds an additional hour to lessons.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sugar Creek Stables is located in Brooklyn, WI, which is about 40 minutes away from the UW-Madison Campus. Team members carpool to the barn for lessons and practices, so owning a car is not necessary.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Horse Shows</strong></p>\r\n<p>Wisconsin Equestrian competes in approximately ten horse shows throughout the school year. These are generally held across five weekends. As riders continue to improve and show dedication to the team, show teams will change throughout the school year. Therefore, not every team member will compete at every show.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social Events</strong></p>\r\n<p>Meetings are held on Wednesdays at 7 PM bi-weekly. Our social chairs also organize at least one social event per month in order to foster team bonding and friendship.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Financial Commitment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Wisconsin Equestrian Team does not receive sponsorship money from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Therefore, most of our funds come from fundraising efforts, the generous donations of friends and family members, and the pockets of our team members. In order to help future members prepare for the financial commitment of being on the team, we have put together a rough estimate based on costs from previous years. Please note that costs are subject to change throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lessons:</strong> $35 each (Members are required to take 22 per year)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hoofer Club Membership:</strong> $125 per year</p>\r\n<p><strong>IHSA Membership: </strong>$45 per year</p>\r\n<p><strong>Driver gas money (not applicable if you are a driver):</strong>&nbsp;approximately $50 per semester</p>\r\n<p><strong>Horse Shows:</strong> approximately $200 per weekend (Includes entry fees, hotel, food, and fleet rental)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, these expenses are spread out throughout both semesters, and payment plans are available to help alleviate financial concerns. This estimate does not include Tournament of Champions series horse shows, Regionals, Zones, or Nationals. The Wisconsin Equestrian Team participates in several fundraising events to help offset the costs of practices and horse shows.</p>",

      "Description": "<p>The <em>Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender &amp; Society</em> grew out of two traditions: the University of Wisconsin Law School&rsquo;s &ldquo;law in action&rdquo; approach and the interdisciplinary design of gender studies. Through &ldquo;law in action&rdquo; we look beyond the statutes and cases to study the practical effects of the law on individuals, marginalized communities, and society at large. The interdisciplinary approach, with an emphasis on gender identity, offers different perspectives through which to expand and challenge our understanding of the law and its implications on society.</p>\r\n<p>The Journal, originally the <em>Wisconsin Women&rsquo;s Law Journal</em><em>, </em>one of the earliest in the nation devoted to the study of women and the law, has strived to contribute insightful scholarship to this evolving field of study. Recognizing that women are a diverse group with differing beliefs and interests, and moreover that gender stereotyping and gender identity discrimination of any kind inhibits each individual&rsquo;s full equality under the law, we encourage articles that examine the intersection of law and gender with issues of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.</p>",

We also encourage pre-business students or students with similar majors outside of the business school to join our organization to gain exposure to the opportunities that exist within the finance and accounting fields.<br /><br />We collaborate with companies such as Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC, Wells Fargo, BMO Harris, JPMC, Forvis, Merrill Lynch all businesses through which we offer networking and volunteering events and professional development workshops. We aim to provide an organization that gives female students not only the confidence to succeed, but also the resources and knowledge they need to meet their goals and venture into their careers.</p>\r\n</div>",

Doing so reminds&nbsp; us that our day to day routine isn&rsquo;t the only thing that is out there. As&nbsp;<em>Yes Theory&nbsp;</em>says, &ldquo;Break out of your routine, and you&rsquo;ll find new creative energy.&rdquo; These change-ups allow us to see the world in a new light and can inspire new ideas. The only issue with trying new experiences is that they can be uncomfortable. We sit in our day to day lives thinking&nbsp;<em>why go out and try something new, that seems like so much work.&nbsp;</em>It's easy to find a million reasons to say&nbsp;<strong>no</strong>, it&rsquo;s hard to say&nbsp;<strong>yes.</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And yet, we find ourselves bored with that day to day life.
